# About

xml2cards converts item descriptions in the [DnD App Files](https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles) format to the JSON
format required by [RPG cards](https://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/generator/generate.html).

The script automatically maps item types to card colors and icons and adds all the properties for you. 

# Requirements

The Python module *pyphen* is used for hyphenation.

# Usage

## Convert

1. Type in the items your group has in a text file (one per line)

2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./xml2cards.py convert items.xml filter.txt output.json
   ```

3. Load the JSON file in RPG cards and edit as you see fit

### Excluding properties

If you want to exclude one or more properties you can do that with the --exclude option:

```
./xml2cards.py convert items.xml filter.txt output.json --exclude weight
```

* ac
* dmg1
* dmg2
* modifier
* property
* range
* roll
* stealth
* value
* weight

## Search

You can also search for items. This matches text anywhere in the name and displays the item description:

```
./xml2cards.py search items.xml potion
```

# Example filter.txt

You can add multiples of an item by writing the count first. Lines starting with # will be ignored.

```
# Valuables
3 Malachite

# Items
Bag of Holding
Ring of Regeneration
# Herbalism Kit
5 Potion of Healing

# Weapons
Warhammer +1
```
